# AeroForecast ✈️

Flight delays are a common occurrence, with an average of 30,000 delayed flights globally each day. In the United States alone, this number ranges from 7,000 to 9,000 flights daily. These delays can significantly impact people's travel plans, causing inconvenience and disruptions. Moreover, the unpredictability and last-minute nature of these delays make it challenging for individuals to plan their personal or business-related circumstances around them. Recognizing the need for a solution, we introduce AeroForecast - an application dedicated to predicting and visualizing flight delays.

## Purpose 🎯

AeroForecast aims to provide a valuable tool for travelers, allowing them to anticipate and plan for potential flight delays. By leveraging two sophisticated models trained on data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the application offers insights into the likelihood of delays, empowering users to make informed decisions about their travel arrangements.

## Key Features 🚀

- **Flight Delay Prediction:** AeroForecast utilizes advanced models to predict the likelihood of flight delays, helping users plan their journeys more effectively.

- **Global Coverage:** The application considers data from a vast number of flights globally, ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy in predictions.

- **Real-time Updates:** AeroForecast provides real-time updates on flight statuses and potential delays, keeping users informed about any changes to their travel plans.

- **User-friendly Visualization:** The intuitive visualization tool enables users to track and understand the probability of delays, allowing for quick and informed decision-making.
