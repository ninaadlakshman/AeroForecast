Flight delays are far from rare. An average of 30,000 delayed flights per day globally, and within the United States alone, that includes 7,000 to 9,000 flights per day. This impacts a significant amount of people’s travel plans every day, and often these delays are last minute or unexpected so it’s difficult for people to plan their personal or business-related circumstances around them. Therefore, there is value in predicting flight delay. A visualization tool to track and predict these delays is clearly a need in the status quo.

AeroForecast is an application designed for this explicit purpose, leveraging two models trained on data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.
